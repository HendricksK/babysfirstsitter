      <h5>Kyle M</h5>
        <p>Babysitter* is a wonderful person as well as babysitter. We were lucky to have her as our sitter for a short while and would have enjoyed having her much longer! She is fun-loving, caring, outgoing, spontaneous and creative. My 14 month old daughter (at the time) was drawn to her right away. She is very engaging with small children. Her spunky personality was a hit with our daughter. She is very happy and pleasant to be around as well as have in your home. Babysitter* exhibits a very positive energy with adults as well as children. </p>

        <p>Thanks so much for looking after our sweet boy so well for us. After a bit of initial first-time-we're-leaving-our-boy anxiety, Husband* and I really felt that we could relax and have a great time out. We really didn't worry and the updates were great to keep us relaxed and happy. We'll most definitely be using you to babysit again!</p>

        <p>Babysitter* is an intelligent, moral, responsible and fun babysitter. She watched my children for two years. They were 3 and 6 when she started with my family. Babysitter* helped my older child with homework, cooked the kids dinner, drove them to after-school activities, bathed them and put them to bed. She also played with them in the park, took them to the beach, and did art projects and sports with them. I trust her completely. She has good judgment, as she demonstrated when watching the children in the pool. She also has upstanding values. I felt that she modeled respectable behavior for my son and daughter. </p>

        <p>I have used the services of this company for many years and have never been disappointed. Babysitter* has always been extremely friendly and trustworthy, and my two daughters are always thoroughly happy in her care. I always recommend Baby's First Sitter to my friends when they need a babysitter.</p>

      <h5>Claire C</h5>
        <p>Babysitter* is the first person outside of family or friends that I ever trusted to leave alone with my children. I knew the moment I met her and saw the rapport that she immediately established with my then 8 month old twins that she was special. She is a genuine, kind person with a warm heart. She loved my children like they were her own and we were so lucky to have had her care for them. She is responsible, smart, good at thinking on her feet in any situation and attentive to the needs of all children no matter their age. Your child will love her the minute they meet her and would be so lucky to have her as their babysitter!</p>
